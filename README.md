# clocker-2.0
This project is a complete rewrite of Clocker, using MongoDB, Node.js, Express, Bcrypt, Passport, and Redis. Includes many additional features.

Clocker is the tool I wish existed during my time in the nonprofit world. This time-keeping app enables organizations to track and analyze project-related human resource allocation. Use it to track volunteerism for multiple grant initiatives, client participation in various programs, or employee hours spent on different tasks. Get rid of those trusty time sheets and sign-in clipboards!


##Goals:

Currently in progress as my final capstone for NSS, my goals are as follows:

1. Create a full, MEAN stack app.
2. Create an authentication strategy using Node.js, Express, Bcrypt, Passport and Redis.
3. Create an API using MongoDB and Mongoose.
4. Better understand and employ MVC structure.
4. Deployment on Digital Ocean using NGINX as a proxy server.
5. Create a mobile component using Ionic and WebSockets to enable remote, location-based sign-ins.
